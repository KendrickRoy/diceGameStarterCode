# Dice Simulator
This project shows two dice that,when the button is clicked, the dice change into a
random number between 1 and 6.

This project functions on a lot of functions and a single click handler.

We could make the dice bigger and a different color. We could also make it the dice do
a rolling animation before giving the number.
